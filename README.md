GetBTSXBalance
==============

Simple utity to get the BTSX Balance from the genesis.json.

I have made this quick tool, to do a quick balance check without using my wallet/s, it just extracts the addresses from the output of "listaddressgroupings" or from a comma separated file.

Usage
============

List Address Groupings
========================

On Bitshares-PTS go to debug and type  "listaddressgroupings"

Copy the output on a text file named "addressGroupings.txt" 


Comma separated file
========================
Create a text file named "addressesCommaSeparated.txt" and type the addresses separated by commas

ie: jlkjfalkfjalkdfjskjgja,jflkadjlfkafjlafjll
